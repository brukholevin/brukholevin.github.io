<h3>A conversation with a young magician.</h3>
<p>Oh, hello! I don't believe we have met. I am Mitu, an apprentice wizard and spiritual seeker on pilgrimage to this place, the holy temple Hiekwyn. It's been closed for a while though.</p>
<p>> What kind of magic do you do?</p>
<p>Um, I am not yet advanced enough to specialize in any particular kind of magic. But I really like transmutation magic, so I study it a little harder than the other types.</p>
<p>If you ever want a demonstration, I can show you! But the subject needs to be alive, I'm not yet powerful enough to transmute inanimate objects.</p>
<p>> Why is that harder?</p>
<p>Um, living things have energy in them already. You have to add energy to a rock, for instance, to transform it into anything else. Even into another inanimate object, like a differently-shaped rock. Since living things have energy, you just have to manipulate what's already there in a particular way to change things!</p>
<p>> Try it on me.</p>
<p>Um. No. I don't have a good enough grasp on the magicks to make sure everything goes as planned yet. I'd hate to hurt you with it!</p>
<p>And besides, you're way too big for me to do anything to. I'm used to practicing on insects and other small creatures.</p>
<br>
<h3>A possible dialogue with the goddess of the physical world.</h3>
<p><b>You miserable whelp</b>. How dare you return after what you've done?</p>
<p>> I've never been here before.</p>
<p>... I see. Think no more of what I have said. You are not who I believed you to be. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>You have a great deal to offer me, young [user chosen name]. What is it that brings you here?</p>
<p>> I'm looking for a way out of this cave.</p>
<p>You... Do you not know where you are?</p>
<p>> Not really.</p>
<p>I see. You are in the temple city, Hiekwyn. I commanded its construction aeons ago, and have been ruling here ever since. It has stood in this place for so long that the earth's motions have swallowed it whole. As it is my chosen location, it has become the primary place for worshippers of my divine power to reside. What ground is more sacred than that chosen by your Lady?</p>
<p>I ask not how you have come to this place, for I truly do not care. Instead, I ask what it is you intend to do here.</p>
<p>> I don't have any intents.</p>
<p>Really? None at all? Just drifting on the wind. You should heed that this wind has brought you to me. I have an important job that requires someone with your abilites.</p>
<p>Are you willing to serve me?</p>
<p>> No.</p>
<p>... Your decision is not final. I know that you will return to me, and you will rescind your denial. Speak to the false-prophet in his disgusting world if you must. Return after you have seen through his nonsense.</p>
<br>
<h3>One possible conversation with a fool who believes he is anything but.</h3>
<p>Oh, and what have we here? Is she a learner, or a spurner?</p>
<p>> Learner.</p>
<p>The self-proclaimed learner often learns the least. A hint for you to begin your journey with: absquatulate learning.</p>
<p>> Ab-what?</p>
<p>Absquatulate.</p>
<p>To learn, you have to assume you know less than what another tells. But what if that other is telling you false? You can't know if they are wrong, or lying, if you don't know the truth yourself.</p>
<p>> Are you lying?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh! Oh. No, this won't do.</p>
<p>You're grasping my lessons too quickly. I can't teach you at this rate! I'll run out of material too fast to make more! No, it wouldn't work. I see that now.</p>
<p>> I don't want to be your student.</p>
<p>I was testing to see if you had the capability! Whether you wanted to or not wasn't even on the table yet! You're hopeless.</p>
<p>... Could you send anyone you think might be a good student my way?</p>
<p>> No.</p>
<p>Fine. Fine! You needn't work for me. You are not beholden to my orders as my students would be. But if you change your mind that's ok. I will forgive you and welcome anyone you find into the fold.</p>

<h3>A short collection of item descriptions.</h3>
<p><b>Caustic Incense</b></p>
<p>An ancient sect of monks once said that the only way to truth and enlightenment was to blind oneself. This was often used in such rituals. It can even burn through metal.</p>
<p><b>Disembodied Eye</b></p>
<p>A severed and pickled eyeball. It is inanimate save for a heatless flame that spews from the pupil without end. Entirely strange and entirely gross.</p>
<p><b>Eternal Candle</b></p>
<p>A candle that burns without end. It is said that the owner of such a candle will be granted eternal life, however useless it may be. Especially in the spirit world where death does not exist. Extremely fragile.</p>
<p><b>Smoulder Ant</b></p>
<p>Once a fire ant, this creature has been severely weakened by transmutation magic. Now it can only start the weakest of blazes, and poses no threat to anyone.</p>
