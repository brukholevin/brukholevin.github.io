<h3 id="famist">Famous Racist:<br>what if you looked up your name on google one day and it said "did you mean: [your name], famous racist?" and there was a wikipedia page about you and it accurately described every experience you had ever had and then described a hate-filled racial manifesto comparable to mein kampf that you are supposed to have written but never did and then next time you went to the movie theater to see Rocky VII: Expendables Edition, Sylvester Stallone reached his big hand out of the screen, pointed at you, and said "this guy is a racist" and then the whole movie theater started attacking you with baseball bats and planks and etc and you died bleeding on the floor due to serious wounds and then Stallone used his laser vision on your corpse to disintegrate your body into ash and you were always remembered for writing a book about racism that you didn't write, that nobody wrote, but was still sold in bookstores somehow</h3><br>

<h3 id="fellda">Fellda:<br>zelda more like fellda because she fell down three flights of stairs and broke her spine in such a way to paralyze her from the neck down and now she needs to use one of those motorized wheelchairs to get around and she doesn't show it but she knows deep down that she is a burden on those closest to her and she just wants to die </h3><br>

<h3 id="grocery-store">Grocery Store:<br>Imagine you're in the grocery store, and over the loudspeakers the One Evangelion Song starts playing and you're confused for a moment but assume someone is just having a laugh but then the store manager who is putting cereal boxes on shelves off a dolly of larger cereal boxes and sees you are confused and looks you dead in the eye and winks and then later when you're in the dairy aisle he is loading the milk jug shelf with jugless milk and as you pass by he grabs you by the collar of your shirt roughly and whispers "Rei is best girl" in a hoary voice and then shoves you away with a wink of the opposite eye from before, and then as you are checking out the song is playing again and you can hear him over the loudspeakers singing along and trying to get you specifically to sing with him threatening that he won't let you leave the store and will call the police to take you away for causing a nuisance unless you sing along</h3><br>

<h3 id="snow">Snow:<br>It is cold. Too cold. At least too cold to be wearing nothing from the waist up. I struggle on regardless. They will return if I do not seem strong enough to continue. I know that I do not look strong enough moving as I am now, limping and stumbling. It does not matter. There is no choice in this. <br>The lone moon looks down on me. You cannot call it shining. I could scarcely tell you where it is without how it blocks the stars. Pity that it sees the cold and empty void of space instead of the cold and empty void of Earth I am in. Even the skies shun this place.<br>I mindlessly pass small trees, victims of winter covered in sheets of pure white. A blanket of cold. Ironic. Even the old symbols of strength and stability bend to this force. Why shouldn't I?<br>The evergreens remain nonplussed. </h3><br>

<h3 id="unknown">Unknown:<br>i'm like fuckin.g Uch. Go duck in an alley. Watch. See what happens. Become embroiled in the inches of rainwater soaking through your piss-riddled biker shoes. Bicycle, not motorcycle. I refuse to use the term "cyclist" because it is an oxymoronic shitstain on the otherwise pure-white semen deposit rag of life. Cunk this virtual horse's ass you reprobatable niantic dildonius. Fuck you.</h3>
