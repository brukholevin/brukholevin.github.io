<h4>There once were two gods. One lorded over the material world, and one over the immaterial. Even as their spheres danced at the border, creating wonders beyond imagining, the two gods were fated to hate one another. Everything one controlled repelled the other like a foul stench. And so they sought a compromise, that they would never need to see each other again. It was not enough for either of them.<br>
<br>
There once was a world split in half. These halves were called Manu and Yemo. Manu felt the effects of entropy, fated to decay into nothing. Yemo felt the lack of entropy, fated to remain constant forever. These halves could not communicate, but travel between the two was possible for the adept and determined.<br>
<br>
There were people in these halves. Born of chaotic interactions, they were of many shapes and sizes. Each had their own goals and their own story to tell. One was a wanderer who lacked knowledge, but was adept and determined. What was her fate?<br>
