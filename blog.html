<h2> Interactive Media and Interactivity </h2>
<p> Lots of people seem very upset over the topic of video games. There is that famous addage that paints them as serious business, and I suppose serious business should be upsetting. Personally, I don't really care about most video games. But as art, they occupy an interesting space. As far as I am aware, they are the only medium where interaction with the art is a core aspect. Games need to account for the player's actions, and these actions could shape the way the experience goes. This is not always the case. Most games keep the playable aspect and the story separate, if they have a story. I think games that do this, though they might be well made and very fun to play, miss the storytelling potential of the medium. Take, for example, games such as Gone Home or Dear Esther (so-called "walking simulators"). These have been controversial in gamer circles, many taking issue with the idea of them being considered "games" at all. In some sense, this criticism is valid. What good is a video game if you cannot interact with it? The story of Dear Esther would not have been irreparably damaged if it were a film. The story of Gone Home would fit well on the pages of a novel. I would argue that if points like these are even possible to consider in the context of video game discussion, the game in question is poorly executed. The story may indeed be good, but if that is the focus of the game, make it so that the player interacts with it during their play sessions. As it stands, many of these walking simulator games tell simple linear stories with no player input at all. What sets video games apart from other mediums is interactivity. If you don't use that to achieve the main goal of your work, then perhaps it would be better served as something else.</p>

<p> My favorite jazz musician is Charles Mingus. Perhaps a bit of a boring choice, but his work is so consistently enjoyable to me that I cannot choose anyone else. Discounting the old legends my favorite jazz musician would be David Binney, followed closely by John Zorn.</p>

<h2> What Makes Art? </h2>
<p> The "Theory of Obscurity" was originally offered by The Residents as an excuse to not release their second album "Not Available". This is not the actual reason it was not released when it was completed, but that's not the focus here. This theory states "artists can produce true art only when the expectations and influences of the outside world are not taken into consideration". This is a good theory, as it presumes art to be solely based in expression rather than being some drive to achieve beauty or other drivel. A theory of this sort can only be created by someone who has an understanding of art that goes beyond the layman's. How many people do you know that would discount a song because it "sounds bad"? How many people do you know that say they like "all music except rap and country", but shrink from complex jazz or harsh noise? Do you know anyone who calls Jackson Pollock some variation of "hack"? These people are missing the core concept behind the theory of obscurity: that creation as an extension of self is the point of art. All creations have some aspect of their creator in them. Each thing an artist makes is necessarily an extension of their self, of their view of the world. It is made for that view to be expressed. Obviously, if someone makes something they want others to experience it. But the artist that makes only for others will invariably make nothing of importance. Art is about the creation because that is what drives it. No art would be made without that desire to create. And since that desire to create is the core aspect of why art happens in the first place, it has to be what art is really about. </p>
