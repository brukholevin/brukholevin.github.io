<h3>A Selection of Interactible Objects in the Game-World</h3>
<h4>Instant Video Exterior -- the initial destination the player works towards. Now out of business.</h4>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I guess I should've...</p>
<p>What town has a video store these days, right?</p>
<p>Ha ha.</p>
<br>
<h4>"Geneva Estates" Apartment Building</h4>
<p>I always wished there were taller buildings in town. Just to have more to look at.</p>
<p>I'd probably have been bored with a skyscraper too, eventually.</p>
<br>
<h4>Abandoned Building</h4>
<p>Oh no, not the arcade...</p>
<p>Doesn't even look like an arcade anymore. How long has it been gone?</p>
<p>I hope the KoF cab found a good home.</p>
<br>
<h4>Plastic Bag</h4>
<p><Oh, come on./p>
<p>What am I, trash patrol?</p>

<h3>A Selection of Inventory Items</h3>
<h4>Funeral Leaflet</h4>
<p><b>Examine:</b></p>
<p>The leaflet from uncle Roy's funeral.</p>
<p><b>Interact:</b></p>
<p>I don't think I have any other pictures of him.</p>
<br>
<h4>Sales File</h4>
<p><b>Examine:</b></p>
<p>It's probably alright that I took this off the desk, right? It's been there for a year.</p>
<p><b>Interact:</b></p>
<p>4554 Janowitz Drive. Out past the woods.</p>
<p>This is such a bad idea.</p>
<br>
<h4>Stick</h4>
<p><b>Examine:</b></p>
<p>Brown and stick-y.</p>
<p><b>Interact:</b></p>
<p>People have been using these forever. Carry the torch, Eliza.</p>

<h3>A Selection of Conversations</h3>
<h4>With Hardware Store Cashier</h4>
<p>Eliza: Hi.</p>
<p>Cashier: Hey.</p>
<p>Eliza: Is, uh, Mr. Herczek around?</p>
<p>Cashier: Nah, he's not here that often.</p>
<p>Cashier: You need to talk to him?</p>
<p>Eliza: No, I just...</p>
<p>Eliza: I used to live here. Thought he'd still be at the register.</p>
<p>Cashier: Nah, he can't take all the standing these days.</p>
<p>Eliza: Couldn't he just use a chair?</p>
<p>Cashier: You'd think.</p>
<br>
<h4>Final Conversation, With Known Friend "Bev"</h4>
<p>...</p>
<p>Eliza: Please pick up.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bev: Hello?</p>
<p>Eliza: Hey, Bev?</p>
<p>Bev: Eliza! Where are you? It's like, eleven!</p>
<p>Eliza: I'm at, uh... 4554 Janowitz Drive.</p>
<p>Bev: What?</p>
<p>Eliza: 4554 Janowitz Drive. It's at the edge of town.</p>
<p>Bev: Why are you all the way out there?</p>
<p>Eliza: It's a long story. Can you, uh...</p>
<p>Eliza: Can you come pick me up?</p>
<p>Eliza: I don't think I can find my own way back, it's too dark.</p>
<p>Bev: Are you alright?</p>
<p>Eliza: I...</p>
<p>Eliza: I'm fine.</p>
<p>Bev: That doesn't sound like you're fine.</p>
<p>Eliza: I'm not, like, hurt. Just kind of...</p>
<p>Eliza: eeeh. Y'know?</p>
<p>Bev: Is that why you're out in the sticks?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Eliza: I guess so, yeah.</p>
<p>Bev: Okay. Give me like, fifteen.</p>
<p>Eliza: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p>Bev: You owe me, though.</p>
<p>Bev: If I'm ever out in the middle of nowhere and need a ride home...</p>
<p>Eliza: Alright, alright.</p>
<p>Bev: See you soon.</p>
<p>Eliza: See ya.</p>
