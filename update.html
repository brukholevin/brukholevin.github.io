<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires the hiring of a distributor for content to be put on the platform, so nothing here will ever be there. They can burgle their convents in their own time. As for the content of the release, it is much better than F.P.U.O.
