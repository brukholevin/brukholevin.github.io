<h1>Kenoma (again), Scorpions of the Earth / Dryin' in a Dead Age / "The Split"</h1>
<h2>02/06/2026</h2>
<p>Happy new year. Three new musical collections for you today. They've been in production for longer than Kenoma was, which should explain why they combine to form twenty tracks. Many times waylaid and left by the wayside, it is somehow a fairly cohesive collection despite its piecemeal construction. The idea was initially just two EPs, but I added "The Split" to act as a catch-all for songs that ended up not fitting either. This mostly worked. Some concepts were still left on the cutting room floor, but that's life. You'll see them someday. Or not.<br><br>Kenoma has released as well. I forgot to write a blog-post to go along with it, so I suppose you'll be treated to a double-post here. In all I am proud of what I achieved artistically with the game, though I wish it hadn't taken so long. So it goes with all things, I suppose. Monetarily it has failed to reach "phone book numbers", as it were, but it was never going to do that. Too niche, too niche. I will have to settle for a potential future in the "cult classic" space, if even that.<br><br>On the future-front, I'm looking back and forward at the same time. Setting my eyes far apart from one another in the hopes i can catch something, like a chameleon.</p>

<h1>Principessa della magia del sangue</h1>
<h2>10/13/2025</h2>
<p>This year's post, I guess, will be about the new video game, whose title is up there as the title of this post. A short, atmospheric journey inspired mostly by Califone's <i>Villagers</i> and Lynch's <i>Twin Peaks</i>, though both are rather oblique to the game itself. King Crimson's <i>Discipline</i> also must have had some kind of impact, but I do not know what it was.<br><br>The game itself is a short, atmospheric journey through the emotions that appear when returning to your childhood hometown, with all the childhood feelings welling back up. Homecoming, in a word. Perhaps more bittersweet than a dance.<br><br>Kenoma still isn't out, which is soon to be rectified. Hopefully it will be successful. Once that's over and done with, more will be coming down the pipeline. 'Principessa' as an experiment in fast-paced game development has emboldened me.<br><br>And of course, more music is ever-approaching.</p>

<h1>Kenoma, Cloak, Et cetera</h1>
<h2>04/03/2024</h2>
<p>Been a while. New front-burner project is Kenoma: Action Without Action, if you hadn't noticed by the general stopping of other projects coming through the pipe after its announcement. Video games take a lot of work to make well, it turns out. Hopefully it will be finished soon-ish. The narrative and ludic elements will be worth the wait, I assure you.<br><br>Cloak was released a few months after Neronomicon, and its absence here was no mistake. I'll save the details and say there have been many struggles this time around the sun. Hopefully the worst has passed, and it will be smooth sailing from here.<br><br>As for everything else, I have not forgotten my initial bent. Upon release of Kenoma, and after a potential wave of post-launch bug-fixes, an arrangement of its soundtrack will be released through the usual channels. After that, more unrelated music. More video games too, in all likelihood. Stay tuned.</p>

<h1>Neronomicon Released</h1>
<h2>01/01/2023</h2>
<p>New release. This one has been a long time coming, in major part because of situations outside the control of anyone involved. Additionally, this is the first collaborative work yet produced. Links to the collaborator would be provided, if there were any. Think of this as a debut, in a sense. It is strange coincidence that this is released two years, nearly to the day, from Ⲇц☩'s release. A reminder of how far one can go in such little time, I suppose. More to come, and very soon if all goes according to plan.</p>

<h1>B.L.O.S.M. Released</h1>
<h2>09/12/2022</h2>
<p>New release. This time it is explicitly intended for use by the public, instead of simply permitting such. B.L.O.S.M. is a pack of 60 samples, and hopefully will be used in at least that many creations by interested individuals. More will come from this project. Stay tuned, but be patient.</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>The Simulacrum Released</h1>
<h2>07/09/2022</h2>
<p>New release. Further toying with the concept of long-form creation, as was the intent of Below, Beyond. Perhaps this is an improvement? Only time will tell. The music is, hopefully, constructed such that there is the feeling of a story being told. What story it is, is your decision.</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>Misirlou Released</h1>
<h2>06/26/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A small experiment in shorter-form content. Expect a few of these every aeon or so. Good way to breathe life into decrepit old ideas. The next release will be longer in form. It will also not be the previously mentioned public domain styled release. Eventually.</p>

<h1>The Mind-Killer Released, Whaling Story Added, Content Restructuring</h1>
<h2>05/04/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A project I am quite proud of. Combines many things I enjoy very much. More coming, in the style of public domain. Later than sooner? Perhaps.<br> <br>
New text added: short story about whalers in a science-fiction setting. <br> <br>
Website has been restructured: at the behest of the web host, large audio files have been shifted to storage on MEGA. In addition, these files have proper metadata. This should make them more easily-used in most music-playing applications. All files in FLAC format.</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>Below, Beyond Released</h1>
<h2>04/20/2021</h2>
<p>New release. Ambient, open-ended. Interesting experiment. More down the pipeline, but do not expect this pace to continue. Large pieces find few homes on the net. Or is it Beyond, Below?</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires the hiring of a distributor for content to be put on the platform, so nothing here will ever be there. They can burgle their convents in their own time. As for the content of the release, it is much better than F.P.U.O.</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>Website Up</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p> This is the first "news" posted on the new website. Here is where updates about various projects and media hosted here will be posted. Don't expect much detail until a release happens. Posts will be infrequent.</p>
