<h1>B.L.O.S.M. Released</h1>
<h2>09/12/2022</h2>
<p>New release. This time it is explicitly intended for use by the public, instead of simply permitting such. B.L.O.S.M. is a pack of 60 samples, and hopefully will be used in at least that many creations by interested individuals. More will come from this project. Stay tuned, but be patient.</p>

<h1>The Simulacrum Released</h1>
<h2>07/09/2022</h2>
<p>New release. Further toying with the concept of long-form creation, as was the intent of Below, Beyond. Perhaps this is an improvement? Only time will tell. The music is, hopefully, constructed such that there is the feeling of a story being told. What story it is, is your decision.</p>

<h1>Misirlou Released</h1>
<h2>06/26/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A small experiment in shorter-form content. Expect a few of these every aeon or so. Good way to breathe life into decrepit old ideas. The next release will be longer in form. It will also not be the previously mentioned public domain styled release. Eventually.</p>

<h1>The Mind-Killer Released, Whaling Story Added, Content Restructuring</h1>
<h2>05/04/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A project I am quite proud of. Combines many things I enjoy very much. More coming, in the style of public domain. Later than sooner? Perhaps.<br> <br>
New text added: short story about whalers in a science-fiction setting. <br> <br>
Website has been restructured: at the behest of the web host, large audio files have been shifted to storage on MEGA. In addition, these files have proper metadata. This should make them more easily-used in most music-playing applications. All files in FLAC format.</p>

<h1>Below, Beyond Released</h1>
<h2>04/20/2021</h2>
<p>New release. Ambient, open-ended. Interesting experiment. More down the pipeline, but do not expect this pace to continue. Large pieces find few homes on the net. Or is it Beyond, Below?</p>

<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires the hiring of a distributor for content to be put on the platform, so nothing here will ever be there. They can burgle their convents in their own time. As for the content of the release, it is much better than F.P.U.O.</p>

<h1>Website Up</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p> This is the first "news" posted on the new website. Here is where updates about various projects and media hosted here will be posted. Don't expect much detail until a release happens. Posts will be infrequent.</p>
