<h1>The Mind-Killer Released, Whaling Story Added, Content Restructuring</h1>
<h2>05/04/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A project I am quite proud of. Combines many things I enjoy very much. More coming, in the style of public domain. Later than sooner? Perhaps.<br> <br>
New text added: short story about whalers in a science-fiction setting. <br> <br>
Website has been restructured: at the behest of the web host, large audio files have been shifted to storage on MEGA. In addition, these files have proper metadata. This should make them more easily-used in most music-playing applications. All files in FLAC format.

<h1>Below, Beyond Released</h1>
<h2>04/20/2021</h2>
<p>New release. Ambient, open-ended. Interesting experiment. More down the pipeline, but do not expect this pace to continue. Large pieces find few homes on the net. Or is it Beyond, Below?

<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires the hiring of a distributor for content to be put on the platform, so nothing here will ever be there. They can burgle their convents in their own time. As for the content of the release, it is much better than F.P.U.O.

<h1>Website Up</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p> This is the first "news" posted on the new website. Here is where updates about various projects and media hosted here will be posted. Don't expect much detail until a release happens. Posts will be infrequent.</p>
