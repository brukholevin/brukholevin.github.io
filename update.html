<h1>New Project</h1>
<h2>01/XX/2021</h2>
<p> Sharing very little as it is still very much in the concept phase. Massive teeth. Suffice it to say, next project will be interactive.</p>

<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires you to hire a distributor for your content to be put on the platform, so nothing I make will ever be there. They can burgle their convents for all I care. As for the content of the release, I find it to be much better than F.P.U.O.. Funny enough, my two favorite tracks are the first song (which was written first), and the seventh (which was written last). Note that by "seventh" I mean the track numbered "07" on the site, which is track "13" on other platforms. It was one of my least favorites originally, but really surged forward in the edit.

<h1>Website Up</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p> This is the first "news" posted on the new website. Here is where updates about various projects and media created by me will be posted. Don't expect much detail until a release happens. Posts will be infrequent.</p>
