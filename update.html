<h1>Kenoma, Cloak, Et cetera</h1>
<h2>04/03/2024</h2>
<p>Been a while. New front-burner project is Kenoma: Action Without Action, if you hadn't noticed by the general stopping of other projects coming through the pipe after its announcement. Video games take a lot of work to make well, it turns out. Hopefully it will be finished soon-ish. The narrative and ludic elements will be worth the wait, I assure you.<br><br>Cloak was released a few months after Neronomicon, and its absence here was no mistake. I'll save the details and say there have been many struggles this time around the sun. Hopefully the worst has passed, and it will be smooth sailing from here.<br><br>As for everything else, I have not forgotten my initial bent. Upon release of Kenoma, and after a potential wave of post-launch bug-fixes, an arrangement of its soundtrack will be released through the usual channels. After that, more unrelated music. More video games too, in all likelihood. Stay tuned.

<h1>Neronomicon Released</h1>
<h2>01/01/2023</h2>
<p>New release. This one has been a long time coming, in major part because of situations outside the control of anyone involved. Additionally, this is the first collaborative work yet produced. Links to the collaborator would be provided, if there were any. Think of this as a debut, in a sense. It is strange coincidence that this is released two years, nearly to the day, from Ⲇц☩'s release. A reminder of how far one can go in such little time, I suppose. More to come, and very soon if all goes according to plan.</p>

<h1>B.L.O.S.M. Released</h1>
<h2>09/12/2022</h2>
<p>New release. This time it is explicitly intended for use by the public, instead of simply permitting such. B.L.O.S.M. is a pack of 60 samples, and hopefully will be used in at least that many creations by interested individuals. More will come from this project. Stay tuned, but be patient.</p>

<h1>The Simulacrum Released</h1>
<h2>07/09/2022</h2>
<p>New release. Further toying with the concept of long-form creation, as was the intent of Below, Beyond. Perhaps this is an improvement? Only time will tell. The music is, hopefully, constructed such that there is the feeling of a story being told. What story it is, is your decision.</p>

<h1>Misirlou Released</h1>
<h2>06/26/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A small experiment in shorter-form content. Expect a few of these every aeon or so. Good way to breathe life into decrepit old ideas. The next release will be longer in form. It will also not be the previously mentioned public domain styled release. Eventually.</p>

<h1>The Mind-Killer Released, Whaling Story Added, Content Restructuring</h1>
<h2>05/04/2022</h2>
<p>New release. A project I am quite proud of. Combines many things I enjoy very much. More coming, in the style of public domain. Later than sooner? Perhaps.<br> <br>
New text added: short story about whalers in a science-fiction setting. <br> <br>
Website has been restructured: at the behest of the web host, large audio files have been shifted to storage on MEGA. In addition, these files have proper metadata. This should make them more easily-used in most music-playing applications. All files in FLAC format.</p>

<h1>Below, Beyond Released</h1>
<h2>04/20/2021</h2>
<p>New release. Ambient, open-ended. Interesting experiment. More down the pipeline, but do not expect this pace to continue. Large pieces find few homes on the net. Or is it Beyond, Below?</p>
<hr noshade>
<h1>Ⲇц☩ Released</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p>New release, put it on all the applicable platforms. Spotify requires the hiring of a distributor for content to be put on the platform, so nothing here will ever be there. They can burgle their convents in their own time. As for the content of the release, it is much better than F.P.U.O.</p>

<h1>Website Up</h1>
<h2>01/02/2021</h2>
<p> This is the first "news" posted on the new website. Here is where updates about various projects and media hosted here will be posted. Don't expect much detail until a release happens. Posts will be infrequent.</p>
